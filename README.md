Compute-Shaders

This is a simple implementation of a Compute Shader API I developed to help better learn both Vulkan and OpenGl. A similar code structure exists in each of the two folders ([Vulkan](https://github.com/jdbener/Compute-Shaders/tree/master/src/Vulkan) and [OpenGL](https://github.com/jdbener/Compute-Shaders/tree/master/src/OpenGL)), with a BoilerPlate file providing the initalization for the rendering API, accompanied by analgous class files containing the implementation of the API.

The main.cpp file includes some tests for the API in both backends.
